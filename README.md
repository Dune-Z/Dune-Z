Pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Science and Technology of China, my research interests have shifted towards exploring innovative methodologies to achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in the wake of Large Language Models (LLMs). My current focus lies in the development of programmable and explainable artificial intelligence systems. Presently, I am engaged in a research project at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and will be joining the System, AI, and Machine Learning for Programming (SAMPL) group at the University of Washington to further advance my research endeavors in the summer of 2023.
